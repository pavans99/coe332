<h1>Refresher: Python Fundamentals<\h1>

ex1.py contains a script that determines if each integer in a list of 10 integers is odd or even. Modulus and a for loopare used to achieve the objective of the exercise.
ex2.py finds all the prime numbers between 3 and 100 inclusive. This task is accomplished using a nested loop and by checking the modulus of each number in the list, say n, with all numbers that are less than (n/2)+1. If any of the moduli are zero then the number is not prime.
ex3.py prints a column with the orginal numbers 1-10, a second column that contains the squares of each number in the first column, and a third column that contains the cubes of each number in the first column. This task is accomplished using a simple loop to square and cube the terms in the first list(column).
ex4.py prints the last 10 lines of usr/share/dict/words. This task is accomplished by reading the last ten lines of the file into a list and then printing the lines sequentially.
ex5.py prints all words starting with 'pyt'. This task is accomplished by looping through every line and checking if the word starts with 'pyt'. If the word satisfies this condition, it is printed.
