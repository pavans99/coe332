<h1>Flowchart of Midterm Flask API Routes</h1>
The flowchart describes the various API routes of the Flask application built in the Midterm. The flowchart follows a pattern of describing a request that can be made to the application and then describing the result of the request. The flowchart has three different shapes to specify the action taking place. Ovals indicate a request, rectangles indicate the output of a GET request, and the rhombus indicates the result of a POST request. The output of a GET request is data or informational text printed to the terminal. The output of a POST request is the downloading and reading of data, which has no visible output to the user except for a short message confirming the data has been downloaded and read.
